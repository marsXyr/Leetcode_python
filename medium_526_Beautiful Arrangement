Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.


Solution: Backtracking
    搜索函数定义为：solve(idx, nums)

    其中idx为当前数字的下标，nums为剩余待选数字

    初始令idx = 1, nums = [1 .. N]

    遍历nums，记当前数字为n，除n以外的其余元素为nums'

    若n满足题设的整除条件，则将solve(idx + 1, nums')累加至答案
